# encryption_and_vulnerability_check
This Splunk app checks for Splunk Vulnerability Disclosures and gives you an overview of your environment's encryption status.

Version 2 has its dashboards migrated to the Dashboard Framework with some changes and additions.
Due to limits of the Dashboard Framework's features, drilldowns with tokens are limited, unfortunately.


Biggest changes are the implemented checks for the Splunk Vulnerability Disclosures. These lookups can be updated with the script found under bin (enabled by default). The script runs every 30 minutes and checks for changes on github.

The app contains a few scheduled searches. If you update the lookups OR use the app for the first time, the mitigation status of the SVDs might take a while to update. If you want to fasten things up, run the reports found in the app.

For RBAC, you can use the shipped read-only or writeable role of the app. The app does not contain or need any additional index.


New in version 2.3.1 is a report, which can be ran manually to populate a manual checks lookup. 
After running this, check the lookup in order to solve the manual checks displayed in the Splunk Security Advisories dashboard.


Version 3 of this app will be improved for distributed environments.
